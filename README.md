# LLaMA 2: Hyperboloid Clusters Merging

This repository contains the code, and was developed as a part of the Assignment 4 for the CMU ANLP Course 11-711.

## Features

- **Library Installations**: Automatically installs required dependencies like `geoopt` and `datasets`.
- **Model Loading**: Utilizes Hugging Face's `transformers` library to load and manage LLaMA 2 models.
- **Dataset Integration**: Includes functionality to load datasets directly from Hugging Face's hub.
- **Hugging Face Hub Integration**: Supports authentication and interaction with the Hugging Face model repository.
- **Custom Experiments**: Provides a foundation to test hyperbolic geometry techniques for model merging.

## Setup
